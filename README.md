# Project ESBD - Libraries
Eagle device libraries for a variety of common components, split into 5 distinct categories:

**all-chips** - integrated circuits, including amplifiers, regulators (linear and switching), microcontrollers, and more. 

**all-connectors** - board-to-board and board-to-wire connectors

**all-passives** - resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, LEDs, and crystals

**all-transducers** - sensors and actuators, including buttons, microphones, and displays

**all-miscellaneous** - as of now only contains a fiducial and a schematic frame
